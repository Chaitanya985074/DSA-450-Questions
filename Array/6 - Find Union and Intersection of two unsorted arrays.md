# Find Union and Intersection of two unsorted arrays

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given two unsorted arrays that represent two sets (elements in every array are distinct), find the union and intersection of two arrays.

**Example:**

```
arr1[] = {7, 1, 5, 2, 3, 6} 
arr2[] = {3, 8, 6, 20, 7} 
```

Then your program should print Union as {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20} and Intersection as {3, 6, 7}. Note that the elements of union and intersection can be printed in any order.
