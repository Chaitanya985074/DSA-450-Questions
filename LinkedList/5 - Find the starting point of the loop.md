# Write a program to Find first node of loop in a linked list	

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given a singly linked list of N nodes. Find the first node of the loop if the linked list has a loop. If a loop is present return the node data of the first node of the loop else return -1.

**Examples :**

```
Input: 1-3-2-4-5
         |     |
         - - - -  
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can see that there exists a loop 
in the given linked list and the first
node of the loop is 3. 

Input: 1-3-2-1
Output: -1
Explanation: No loop exists in the above
linked list.So the output is -1.
```
