# Write a program to Add “1” to a number represented as a Linked List.	

Difficulty Level : Medium

Number is represented in linked list such that each digit corresponds to a node in linked list. Add 1 to it. For example 1999 is represented as (1-> 9-> 9 -> 9) and adding 1 to it should change it to (2->0->0->0).

**Examples :**

```
Input: 4->5->6
Output: 457
Explanation: 4->5->6 represents 456 and when 1 is added it becomes 457. 

Input: 1->2->3
Output: 124
Explanation: 1->2->3 represents 123 and when 1 is added it becomes 124.
```
